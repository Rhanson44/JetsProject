# **JetsProject**

## **Project Overview:**

### *Objective*

Create a fleet of jets with different capabilities. Implement an application class which presents the user with a menu of options to access information about the fleet.

### *Sub Objectives*

- Construct an abstract Jet class to outline the model, speed, range, and price of an aircraft
- Create three concrete jet subclasses which extend the Jet class and its fly() method
- Create two interfaces to be implemented by respective sublclasses
- Print a menu with the following options:

1. List fleet
2. Fly all jets
3. View fastest jet
4. View jet with longest range
5. Load all Cargo Jets
6. Dogfight!
7. Add a jet to Fleet
8. Remove a jet from Fleet
9. Quit

### *Stretch Goals*

- On program startup, the airfield is populated with data read from a text file
- Additional menu option to fly an individual jet
- Each jet has a pilot which can be assigned to a jet randomly
- Pilots can be hired by the user
- Pilot information is printed alongisde the jet's information

### *How to Run*

- Upon running program, user will be presented with a menu selection
- Input numbered choice via keyboard
- Appropriate data will be output to the console
- Type Y to continue, or N to terminate program
- Return to step one

### *Concepts Utilized*

> Java Interfaces
  Abstract Classes
  ArrayList
  Input/Output Streams
> Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation

### *Lessons Learned*

- Understand application and syntax of interfaces and abstract classes
- Object oriented design
